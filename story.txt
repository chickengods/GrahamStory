There once was a due name grahm who loved to eat ham. On one fine day
he went out to say, "hello world I am graham, this isn't a shame."
Graham walked down the street without any feet, since he lost them
in a bet. Bam, Graham got shot by the thought that he should get 
some feet, so he doesn't have to be in the sheets.
The End...?

Graham woke up from a terrible dream. He dreamt that he was shot. He got out of bed and decided to eat some bread. After he scratched his head and, with a loud voice he said, "Damn son that really was some good bread." 

But the bread was not bread! It was a tasty head! But that is not bread, oh Graham why must you do that to Sam! That being said, Sam was okay, for Sam was actually a fish filet. Filet he was, and Filet he will be, for Graham had discovered the wonders of ham.

Alas, Graham didn't know his world was a sham.  Fake, like the bread he did not make.  The fish came in a dish, but for it, he did not wish.  Graham was in a dream, within a dream.  The reception to this inception was an exception he couldn't handle.
