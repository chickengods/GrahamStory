There once was a due name grahm who loved to eat ham. On one fine day
he went out to say, "hello world I am graham, this isn't a shame."
Graham walked down the street without any feet, since he lost them
in a bet. Bam, Graham got shot by the thought that he should get 
some feet, so he doesn't have to be in the sheets.
The End.
