There once was a due name grahm who loved to eat ham. On one fine day
he went out to say, "hello world I am graham, this isn't a shame."
Graham walked down the street without any feet, since he lost them
in a bet. Bam, Graham got shot by the thought that he should get 
some feet, so he doesn't have to be in the sheets.
The End...?

Graham woke up from a terrible dream. He dreamt that he was shot. He got out of bed and decided to eat some bread. After he scratched his head and, with a loud voice he said, "Damn son that really was some good bread."
